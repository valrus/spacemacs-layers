* Description
Major mode for entering tablature.  Always use minor modes ~lead-mode~
or ~chord-mode~ instead.

In ~tab-mode~, single keys represent notes on the guitar fretboard, and
pressing them creates tablature.  This only happens if the cursor is
in a tablature staff; otherwise the keys have their normal, text, meaning.

In chord-mode, the cursor remains in place (for entry of multiple-note
chords) until manually moved forward with SPACE or ~forward-char~.  In
lead-mode, the cursor automatically advances after each note.

For more information on a key or action, do:
	~describe-key~ and then enter the key(s) for the action
or
	~describe-function~ and then enter the name of the action

* Install
To use this layer add it to your =~/.spacemacs= file.

** Insert state only

To add notes, use the following bindings. The "base fret" (here represented
by =N=) is shown in the modeline and can be changed with =<= and =>=.

** Normal state only

When in a tablature staff, movement works as follows:
- =hl= move one note rather than one character.
- =HL= move horizontally character-wise.
- =jk= move vertically character-wise.
- =JK= move down or up one staff rather than one line.
- Arrow keys move one character at a time.
- Other 

This table lists the tab-specific bindings so you can rebind them if you want.

** Other commands that aren't bound (or don't work... yet!)

There are a bunch of other commands that aren't bound by default:
some because they're less useful,
some because tablature-mode is 20+ years old and they've broken in the interim.
In particular, regions have no special behavior in tablature and so functions that
are supposed to operate on them won't work.

Tablature mode recognizes when the cursor is on a tab staff (and draws
new tab staffs) with six, three-character long, strings.  Each of the six
must be unique.  To change these strings (e.g. for alternate tunings),
enter them (while *not* in tab-mode) at the beginnings of six consecutive
lines, and use =<SPC> : tab-learn-tuning=.
