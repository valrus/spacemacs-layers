* Description
Major mode for entering tablature.  Always use minor modes ~lead-mode~
or ~chord-mode~ instead.

In ~tab-mode~, single keys represent notes on the guitar fretboard, and
pressing them creates tablature.  This only happens if the cursor is
in a tablature staff; otherwise the keys have their normal, text, meaning.

In chord-mode, the cursor remains in place (for entry of multiple-note
chords) until manually moved forward with SPACE or ~forward-char~.  In
lead-mode, the cursor automatically advances after each note.

For more information on a key or action, do:
	~describe-key~ and then enter the key(s) for the action
or
	~describe-function~ and then enter the name of the action

Tablature mode recognizes when the cursor is on a tab staff (and draws
new tab staffs) with six, three-character long, strings.  Each of the six
must be unique.  To change these strings (e.g. for alternate tunings),
enter them (while *not* in tab-mode) at the beginnings of six consecutive
lines, and use `\\[execute-extended-command] tab-learn-tuning'.
